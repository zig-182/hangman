# Hangman

## Overview 
My rendition of the classic word-guessing game. It was the first application I completed using Python and includes basic game functionality as well as some customization to showcase the concepts I have learnt, whilst attempting to enhance the user experience. 

## Languages

* Python

## Brief Notes

Upon achieving the gameâ€™s initial functionality, I practiced incorporating some of the features I had learnt about such as:

* Giving the users the ability to select the difficulty of the game.

* Enhancing the user experience by outputting more messages in appropriate colours depending on the scenario they experienced.

* Fixing bugs to help the user have a smooth and natural gaming experience e.g. not losing an extra life if the user had already guessed the letter.

Overall, I found it satisfying to build and enhance/extend a game using my newfound python knowledge. It gave me motivation to keep studying and continue exploring what else I can achieve.
